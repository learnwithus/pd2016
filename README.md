## What we are doing ##
We will be creating an online repository of common illnesses. Users will be able to use our website to learn more about common illnesses, or to assist in diagnosing an illness. Users will be able to select symptom “tags” which filter the repository and show relevant illnesses. By selecting an illness, users can see an in depth explanation of the illness, its symptoms, and other additional information. Of course, visiting a doctor is always recommended.

Users will be able to sign up (using Facebook, email, etc.) optionally to discuss remedies and treatments in the comments for each illness, bookmark illnesses for reference, and set up their own profile. Users may go through a verification process to be registered as a medical professional, whose comments will be flared for other users to easily see.
